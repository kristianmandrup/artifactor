## Couch DB adapter

Currently uses [cradle](https://github.com/flatiron/cradle) Couch DB client.

Cradle has support for [Mango](https://github.com/cloudant/mango), which provides a MongoDB API layer for CouchDB.
We will use the Mango API to make it quick and easy to port the Mongo DB adapter to Couch DB.   

[Promisify Cradle with Bluebird promises](https://github.com/flatiron/cradle/issues/293)

We will use the [promised land](https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cradle/tree/promised-land) branch to 

*Promised Land* example:

```js
const cradle = require('cradle');
const client = // configure client
const db = // configure db from client

const P = require('bluebird')
const promisedLand = require('cradle/promised-land');
const promised = promisedLand(P.promisifyAll, {cradle, client, db});
```

You can now use the following promised enabled APIs as you see fit, even with async/await :)

```js
promised.db
promised.client
promised.cradle
```
