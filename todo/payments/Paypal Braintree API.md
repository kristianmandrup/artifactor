## Payment 

We should accept payments via PayPal for now. Later we will add BitCoin as well.
Users will be able to deposit funds via PayPal or Bitcoin to buy *Dev Coins*.

A _Dev Coin_ is a new virtual currency which can be used when trading artefacts.

There are several ways you can obtain Dev Coins:
- Buy them using valid payment method (PayPal, BitCoin, ...)
- Reward from star ratings on published artefacts (see below)

Dev Coin popularity reward:
- 10 = 1
- 20 = 2
- 40 = 4
- 80 = 6
- 150 = 8
- 300 = 12
- 600 = 20
- 1200 = 30
- 2000 = 50
- 4000 = 80
- 10.000 = 100

A 5 star rating = +2 stars
A 4 star rating = +1 star
A 1 star rating = -1 star

Initially $5 buys you one star. Money deposited can never be withdrawn. It belongs to those who run the 
Artefact portal (registry).

## Bounties

Developers can issue requests for additional libarary support or functionality to be added to an Artefact.
The owner of said artefact can then issue a crowd funding request, for a target number of Dev Coins.
Users can then pledge one or more Dev Coins. If the target is reached, the developer may start development of the feature.
When the feature is completed, the pledgers can then approve the feature. If a majority (60% min) approves, the
developer gets all the pledged Dev Coins as a reward.
